I took the assignment within one hour 

I've encountered a problem with the default space at the top of the page, even though I set the margin to 0 in the body tag. However, when I use display: flex with align-items: center, the space at the top disappears. My preferred style for the profile section is to use a light background with a subtle box shadow to make the content appear elevated, ensuring the section stands out while keeping the design clean and modern.
